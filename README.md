# Keras-Yolov2-Implementation-on-ROS-
The task was to subscribe a image through the ros node and publish the predicted image with the coordinates points in another ROS topic. The prediction file in this folder will allow you to do the following task. For this predict to run you need trained model weights of keras yolo. All other files have been taken from keras-yolo2 github library.
